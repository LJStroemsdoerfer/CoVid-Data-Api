# R and Python APIs for CoVid-19 Data on Germany

This repo contains the R and Python libs for the german CoVid-19 datasets published by the <a href="https://npgeo-corona-npgeo-de.hub.arcgis.com/">NPGEO Corona Hub</a>. These libs ease the access to the latest data for epidemiologists and other statistical researchers.

This project started during the <a href="https://wirvsvirushackathon.org/">#wirvsvirus Hackathon</a> hosted by the german chancellery.
